<h1> Assignment 3 </h1>
<h3> Testing and AOP. </h3>

Dear students, <br />

In this assignment, you are required to create a very simple RESTful application using Spring similar to the previous
Assignment 2. (One entity and CRUD operations on that entity is enough - use GET, POST, DELETE,  PUT, PATCH methods). 

<h4> Task related: (25%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Create a CRUD for a single entity</li>
    <li> Perform a validation for data entry in create and update</li>
    <li> Use DTO pattern instead of exposing your entities to the client</li>
    <li> Perform dynamic and automatic mapping using MapStruct instead of manual mapping</li>
</ul>

<h4> Task related: (40%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Write unit tests to test methods of Service class(es). Try to design test scenarios as rich as possible</li>
    <li> Write some integration tests for Controller methods</li>
</ul>

<h4> Task related: (30%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Log a message before each method is called in the Service class(es) with the information about the input parameters</li>
    <li> Log a message after each method is executed in the Service class(es) with the information about the return value</li>
    <li> Log a message after each method is executed in the Service class(es) with the information about the execution time</li>
</ul>

<h4> Submission related: (5%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Record a short video not exceeding 5 minutes to explain the code
        as well as the way users can interact with the end product
        <ul>Show:
            <li> main blocks of the code base</li>
            <li> each of the features mentioned above</li>
            <li> database after the insertion, updates and removals</li>
            <li> logs after each operation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Upload the video to YouTube and share the link by adding it as the first line of your README.md file.</li>
    <li> Submissions without a video submission will not be graded.</li>
</ul>

This assignment will give you <strong>10%</strong> of the total. <br />
<em> Good luck! </em> <br />
